title: "What to consider"
summary:
content: |
  As you read the two articles you've chosen, consider the following questions
  as they relate to the article's content, tone, and sourcing. Don't feel limited to these.

  Take notes as you go. Over the next two weeks, we will discuss what you've found.

  * How does the way Wikipedia discusses this topic differ from the way you understand it?
  * Is everything in the article relevant to the article topic? Think about
  sections, sources, and phrasing. Is there anything that distracted you?
  * Are important aspects of the subject missing or incorrect?
  * Is the article neutral? Are there any claims, or frames, that appear heavily
  biased toward a particular position?
  * Wikipedia seeks to represent perspectives in proportion to their prominence
  in the body of literature on a subject. Are there viewpoints in the article
  that are overrepresented, or underrepresented?
  * Is each fact referenced with an appropriate, reliable reference that supports
  the claim? Where does the information come from? How would you describe the
  quality of the sources?
  * If you were to grade this article, what grade would you give it?
