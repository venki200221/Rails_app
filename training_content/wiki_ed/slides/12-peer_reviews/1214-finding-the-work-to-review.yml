title: Finding the work to review
summary:
content: |
  You can use the 'Sandbox Draft' link to find your classmate's draft that you'll be reviewing.

  If a draft hasn't been published yet, you may see the message "Wikipedia does not have a user
  page with this exact name" instead. In that case, contact your classmate to find out if
  they've posted their work somewhere else.
