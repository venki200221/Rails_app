  If you’re working on an existing article, draft 1-2 sentences on your article’s
  sandbox page. You can find this page by going to the My Articles section on your
  course’s home page and clicking on the link titled “Sandbox Draft.” Check out the
  Talk page, too, to see what other Wikipedians are already contributing.

  Think back to how to evaluate an article. Look at the article's content, tone,
  and sourcing.

  * Is the article's content relevant to the topic? Are some areas under- or over-developed?
  * Is it written neutrally?
  * Does each claim have a citation? Are the citations reliable?
  * Does the article tackle one of Wikipedia's equity gaps (coverage of historically
  underrepresented or misrepresented populations or subjects)?

  What can you add? Consider posting some of your ideas to the article's Talk page.
