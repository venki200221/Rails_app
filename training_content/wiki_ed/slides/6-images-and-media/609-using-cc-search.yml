title: Using Openverse Search
summary:
content: |
  Creative Commons is a non-profit that helps spread the word about free
  licenses. It's not actually connected to Wikipedia, but they've created a
  search engine that will help find materials that fit a certain type of license:
  Openverse. Let's look at how it works.

  First, go to <a href="https://wordpress.org/openverse/" target="_blank">wordpress.org/openverse</a>.

  In the search bar, click "All content" and change it to "Images". Then, type 
  the topic of your search into the search box just like you would with any 
  search engine. Click "Search".

  When results appear, click "Filters" in the upper righthand corner. You MUST 
  click the two boxes "Use commercially" and "Modify or adapt". If you do not 
  click those two boxes, you may NOT be able to use the images you find through 
  this search on Wikipedia.

  When you find an image, make a note. We'll show you later on how to add that 
  image to Wikimedia Commons, so you can include it in your Wikipedia article.
