  Before we continue, you'll need to sign in to a Wikipedia account. **If you
  already have an accessible account**, skip this slide and click "Log in" in the
  upper right corner of this window.

  **If you don't yet have a Wikipedia account**, proceed:

  Some people use their real name on Wikipedia, but we recommend using a pseudonym
  for privacy reasons. All Wikipedia contributions are tied to your username
  indefinitely, including mistakes and edits to controversial topics.

  In a moment, when you sign up, make sure to associate your account with an email
  address and respond to the confirmation email. Wikipedians will be able to send emails to you, but your
  address will *not* be publicly visible. A confirmed email address is the only
  way to recover an account should you forget the password.
