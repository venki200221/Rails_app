title: "Using Slack"
summary:
content: |
  You will receive an invitation to join Slack at the beginning of the course.
  Slack is a chat/messaging service you can access via the web, the downloadable
  program, or the mobile app.

  This is where you can ask questions, share useful links or information, and
  coordinate any collaborative work with your peers. We will have a dedicated
  channel, visible only to course participants and Wiki Education staff. You
  can also send private or group messages.

  Wiki Education staff hold office hours in Slack for an hour every weekday.
  Check your welcome email or Dashboard Home tab for a schedule. If you have
  questions outside of office hours, at night, or over the weekend, you can
  still use Slack. It is a powerful tool for asynchronous communication and
  staff will respond when they can (at latest, by the next day's office hours).
